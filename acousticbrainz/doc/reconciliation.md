# AcousticBrainz Reconciliation

Since all entries in AcousticBrainz pertain to a recording in MusicBrainz, we do not need to reconcile the entries themselves as we can simply link them to the MusicBrainz entities. As such, the only things that need reconciliation the values for certain fields that pertain to tonality, mood, genre, etc.

This file will describe steps take for each field, and the `acousticbrainz/openrefine/` folder will contain history and export files for the reconciliation.

## Gender

The values were reconciled against Q48277 "gender"
