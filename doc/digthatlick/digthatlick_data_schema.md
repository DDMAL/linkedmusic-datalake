This website is one of the main deliverables (i.e. final products) of the Dig That Lick project.

The [homepage](https://dig-that-lick.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/index.html) indicates that the site currently supports four databases:


1. The new DTL1000 database, comprising 300000 tone events in 1736 monophonic solos from over 600 jazz tunes spanning the 100 years of jazz history. The solos have been extracted automatically from audio using a newly developed CRNN-based algorithm specialised for jazz.
2. The well-known Weimar Jazz Database with about 200000 tone events from 456 monophonic solos by 78 jazz masters.
3. The Charlie Parker Omnibook with about 18000 tones taken from 52 solos by the co-inventor of bebop.
4. The Essen Folk Song Collection, comprising about 350000 notes from 7352 folk songs.

Additional info:
1. solo_id: looks like: AQAD-EqXKIqegOmiDWIyCXeWCecPP0cR_0.00.46.043990-0.01.25.005469, a unique id for each solo
    the first 32 characters are not unique per solo, but are unique per track which the solo is on, the rest are jsut the time stamps of the recorded solo.
    odd thing is that in the time stamps, the miliseconds part has an extra 0 in front, which does not show up when u use this as url and doesnt work must be removed ie

2. possible_solo_performer_names:
    In each row (for each solo), only one of this column and the solo_performer_name column will be filled

3. performer_names:
    list of all the musicians performing on the track/recording

4. solo_performer_name:
    musician who is for sure performing the solo at the time on this recording

12.  area: could be city, could be more general, could also be multiple places, could also be more specific like a venue: for example:
    most are like New York, Chicago, blah
    but some are like: Milan, Italy
    or Camden, N.j.
    theres also Chicago, and then Chicago, IL
    and then venue: Live "Jazzhus Montmartre", Copenhagen, Denmark


13. instrument_label:, abbreviated, note for reconciliation, expanded to match with wikidata, also used as property instrument for reconcile solo performer, but ts becomes saxophone because whenever someone plays tenor sax, for some reason in wikidata they just put saxophone
put back to tenor saxophone after
