# Explanation of The Session's Data Structure and RDF Schema

This document is yet complete.


# 1. Namespaces Defined

@prefix xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .  
@prefix wd:   <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> .  
@prefix wdt:  <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> .  
@prefix geo:  <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#> .  
@prefix ts:   <https://thesession.org/> .

xsd is the standard XML datatype definition which we help us define the literals we store (e.g. "this is a dateTime data").  
wd is for wikidata entities; wdt is for wikidata properties.  
ts is for the Session entities (e.g. recordings, sessions), who often don't have an equivalent in Wikidata.  
geo is for geographic coordinates (e.g. Point(42.24073792 -71.00814819))

# 3. Schema of The Session Dataset

## 3.1 General Structure of The Dataset
We have obtained 7 files from [the Session's official Github repository](https://github.com/adactio/TheSession-data). 

The files are:

|file | description | additional remarks|
|------|-------------|------------------|
|events.csv | concerts featuring Irish traditional music |
|tunes.csv | traditional Irish compositions | 
|recordings.csv | Irish traditional music recordings/albums | A recording usually features multiple traditional tunes|
|sessions.csv | periodic gatherings where attendees can play Irish music together, like a "jam session" | See [Irish traditional music session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_traditional_music_session)
|tunes-aliases.csv |alternative names by which a tune/composition is known| 
|sets.csv | User-curated collections of tunes, like playlists| This metadata is not the most relevant to our project | 
|tunes-popularity.csv | number of times which a user has added a tune/composition into a "tunebook" | This metadata is not the most relevant to our project


### 3.1.1 Some Questions and Answers

#### Question 1:  How are Events Different from Sessions?
In short, events are concerts. As you know, concert attendees usually listen to performers without making music themselves. Events have a fixed start date and end date (e.g. June 10th, 2006, 9:30pm â€“ 11pm).

On the other hand, sessions are like "jam sessions", in which attendees are expected to bring an instrument and play with others. Sessions occur periodically at a same location (e.g. Wednesday at Lapa Irish Pub ): thesession.org would remove a session if it is no longer active!

#### Question 2: Why is there not an artists.csv, nor a composers.csv?
Good question! You may have noticed on thesession.org that recordings have artists (https://thesession.org/recordings/artists/2983) and that tunes sometimes have composers (https://thesession.org/tunes/composers/2). However, thesession.org was not designed to be artist-centered, and artist profile contains almost no information on the artists, apart from an occasional Bandcamp or Soundcloud link. 

Besides, we really wish to avoid referencing this URI pattern (https://thesession.org/recordings/artists/{number}) in our RDF, since it is really confusing. 

Considering additionally that thesession.org may not be set up to handle too many of concurrent request,  we recommend not to scrape the websitesite for artists or composers id.

#### Question 3: What additional data exists the thesession.org, but is not included in our dataset?
Apart from artists and composers id, the dataset omits various memeber-related statistics that could be retrieved from scraping thesession.org. Thankfully, most of these data do not seem relevant to the LinkedMusic project.
