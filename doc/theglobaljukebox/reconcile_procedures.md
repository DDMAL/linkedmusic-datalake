# Applying Histories:
> Do this before reading further.
- In the `reconciliation_history` folder, JSON files are generated in OpenRefine via `Undo/Redo > Extract... > Export`.
- These files can be applied to a specific CSV in OpenRefine by using `Undo/Redo > Apply...` and selecting the corresponding JSON.
- This process might cause errors during reconciliation. If this happens, please check below for detailed reconciliation instructions.

# Instruments

## Data

> Note: This dataset is small, so it is possible to manually reconcile much of the instrument and culture columns.
- Reconcile the cells in column `Instrument_Name` to type `family of musical instruments` (Q1254773) using `Sachs_Number` as property `Hornbostel-Sachs classification` (P1762).
    - Manually match any items that seem like they would get automatically mismatched/missed.
