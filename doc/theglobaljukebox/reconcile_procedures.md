# General Notes:

- The Global Jukebox data dump can be found in the 8 repositories in [The Global Jukebox Github](https://github.com/theglobaljukebox).
  > IMPORTANT: Before reconciling a column, make a copy first titled `[Name_literal]` in order to preserve the string literals.
      - If splitting columns, make the copies after splitting the column, as a string literal list is not helpful when querying.
- For each dataset in The Global Jukebox, the `codings.csv` file is skipped, as it does not contain easily reconcilable data.
- The `data.csv` files are also not particularly useful for reconciliation, as they depend on the codings found in `codings.csv` and, consequently, not much easily reconilable to WikiData. However, depending on the data set, there may be a few columns that can be reconciled.
- By reconciling the remaining files, we should be able to link the surrounding information that can be found in WikiData.
- The datasets are small, so it is possible to manually reconcile many of the columns after a first automatic pass (or a few passes).

# Applying Histories:

> Do this before reading further.

- In the `reconciliation_history` folder, JSON files are generated in OpenRefine via `Undo/Redo > Extract... > Export`.
- These files can be applied to a specific CSV in OpenRefine by using `Undo/Redo > Apply...` and selecting the corresponding JSON.
- This process might cause errors during reconciliation. If this happens, please check below for detailed reconciliation instructions.

# Exporting Data:

- When exporting to CSV, choose `Export > Custom Tabular...`
- For each reconciled column, make sure you select the "Matched entity's ID" option.
- Before exporting, make sure to copy and save the Option Code.
- To export, select "Comma-separated values (CSV)" and click "Download".
