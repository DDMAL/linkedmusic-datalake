There are two video recordings demonstrating how to convert relational databases (RDB) to RDF within Open Link Virtuoso, while simultaneously mapping the RDB schema to an ontology. 

It took CantusDatabase (an example .sql file) for instance. The file is named pg_sampleForCantusDatabase_Lucas.sql.zip, located in the `linkedmusic-datalake/data/cantus` directory.
