# Reconciliation todo

This file documents a list of improvements to the reconciliation procedure that were found during the RDF conversion process

- reconcile blank node values for music encodings (e.g. MEI)
- re reconcile all the keymode and timesig columns
- go through all rdfs label for blank nodes that are summaries for material groups and find a property for every unique value (wait for a decision to be made on material groups, see [#444](https://github.com/DDMAL/linkedmusic-datalake/issues/444))
