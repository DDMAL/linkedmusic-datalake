# RISM Data Processing Guide

This document outlines the process for handling RISM (RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales) data provided by Andrew Hankinson.

## Prerequisites

### OpenRefine Setup
1. Install [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), version 3.9 and above.
2. Install the [RDF-extension](https://github.com/stkenny/grefine-rdf-extension).
3. Install [RDF-transform](https://github.com/AtesComp/rdf-transform) for transforming OpenRefine project data to RDF-based formats, based on RDF-extension.

### Mapping Configuration
- Review the mapping file at `/linkedmusic-datalake/data/rism/reconciled/mapping.json`.
- Detailed mapping decisions are documented in `/linkedmusic-datalake/data/rism/reconciled/mappingWithLog.json5`.

## Processing Workflow

### 1. Splitting the Graph
1. Open a terminal in the `linkedmusic-datalake` directory
2. Navigate to `./code/rism`
3. Run the splitting script using either:
    - `python3 force_split.py` for the default 500MB chunk size
    - `python3 force_split.py [size]` for a custom chunk size (e.g., `python3 force_split.py 500` for 500MB)
4. The processed files with corrected predicates will be saved to `/linkedmusic-datalake/data/rism/split_output`

### 2. Processing with OpenRefine
> Note: Red circles or rectangles in screenshots indicate elements you need to click on. Other annotations are for reference only.

For each file in the split_output directory (starting with e.g., `part_1.ttl`, in which all the blank nodes from the original RDF n-triples file are already converted to specific URIs):

1. **Create a new OpenRefine project**:
    - Open the file from `/linkedmusic-datalake/data/rism/split_output/part_1.ttl`

2. **Apply the RDF skeleton for RISM**:

    > Note: The ontology file is moved to `/linkedmusic-datalake/code/rism/ontology`

3. **Reconcile the type column**:

    Navigate to rism/data/reconciled:

    > Note: The OpenRefine step files are moved to `/linkedmusic-datalake/code/rism/openrefine`

    ![RDF Skeleton](./assets/07.jpg)

    > Note: OpenRefine has a bug at this step that may prompt you to select the file multiple times. Simply reselect the same file each time when prompted.

4. **Reconcile all cell of the "label" predicates for Human/Person subjects**:

    ![RDF Skeleton](./assets/10.jpg)

5. **Apply judgment to unreconciled cells**:
    > **IMPORTANT**: Make your own informed decisions for unreconciled cells. The repository does not contain predefined judgments as this is for testing purposes.

6. **Reconcile other relevant columns** as needed (refer to the step history for guidance)

7. **Export the RDF data**:
    ![RDF Skeleton](./assets/13.jpg)

8. **Repeat steps 1-7** for all remaining files in `/linkedmusic-datalake/data/rism/split_output/`

9. **Move all reconciled files** (`.nt` format) to `/linkedmusic-datalake/data/rism/split_input/`

> An error might happen here where the output file is empty.
10. **Preventing Output Error**: Repeat step 2 to apply the RDF transform again to avoid the output error.

### 3. Joining the Processed Files
1. Navigate to `/linkedmusic-datalake/code/rism/`
2. Run `python3 force_join.py`
3. The final output will be created at `/linkedmusic-datalake/data/rism/joined_output.ttl`
4. This joined file is the complete processed RISM dataset
