"""
This script accepts a folder name as a commandline argument. 
It reads a mapping.json file and all .csv files in that folder.

For each CSV file provided as input, the script performs the following steps:

1.  Read folder: If a mapping file already exists, 
then the script reads that file and saves any predicate mappings that exist in that file.
2.  Extract Headers: The script extracts the headers from each CSV file.
3.  Write to JSON: If a column header extracted from a CSV file was mapped
in the existing mapping file, keep the existing mapping. If we find a header that
did not exist in the existing mapping file, create a key for that header with a blank
predicate value.  The script writes the resulting mapping to a JSON file,
which will serve as the mapping file for the csv2rdf_single_subject.py script.
